<h1>The Big Idea:</h1>
<p> Using Truman State University's 2015 version of the Student Code of Conduct, located in Kirksville, MO,
        we designed a game aimed at teaching kindness and good citizenship to everyone. Truman State University
	students have the added bonus of becoming more familear with their code of conduct, learning more about
	their chosen university as well as become a better human being. </p>
